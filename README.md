## 🚀 Features
- 🟢 **Real-time detection** with YOLOv11n pretrained on COCO.  
- 🎨 **Color webcam feed** with bounding boxes and labels.  
- ⏱️ **30-second persistence tracking** to announce only stable objects.  
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech** integration using `pyttsx3`.  
- 🧩 **Modular code**: separate functions for detection, tracking, and TTS.  
- 📋 Final **stable objects list** printed at the end for verification.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-identification-cnn.git
cd object-identification-cnn
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🖥️ Usage
- Run the Jupyter notebook (`obj_soundv2.ipynb`) and execute cells in order.
- Or convert to Python script and run:
   python obj_sound.py
- Press `q` to quit the webcam feed.
- Objects that remain visible for 30 seconds will be announced via TTS.
> Tip: Lower the threshold in update_object_tracking() for faster testing (e.g., 5 seconds).
